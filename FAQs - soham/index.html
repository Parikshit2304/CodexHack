                <p>With several hundred customers already in line, we expect to expand flight rates during the early years of commercial operations without sacrificing safety or experience. We want you to experience space at the earliest possible opportunity and will be working hard to achieve that.We will also make sure that the period before your spaceflight is a highly valuable part of your journey with us. The anticipation and preparation for any life event, particularly spaceflight, is of great importance to the experience itself. You will prepare within the Future Astronaut community, alongside others who are making the same journey.

                <p>Completion of a traditional fitness test is not required, but the flight is a relatively intense sensory and physical experience. If you are able-bodied and cleared by a medical practitioner, you should be able to enjoy both your training and your spaceflight. However, like many things in life, being in the best possible shape is likely to enhance your experience, and we will align with you on your personal goals during your spaceflight readiness program.</p>

                <p>Immediately prior to your spaceflight, you will participate in a multi-day training and preparation period at Spaceport America focused on ensuring you fly safely, and that you are equipped to savor every second of it. We want you to have fun, enjoy incredible hospitality and bond with your fellow astronauts and pilots. A warm welcome awaits all friends and family accompanying you to New Mexico to share your experience, and to support you as you approach the long-anticipated day of spaceflight.</p>

                <p>The goal of our spaceflight readiness program is to foster bonding and collaboration to create a crew that is fully equipped to enjoy themselves during spaceflight. Training will be completed alongside your fellow astronauts, where you will cover everything from weightlessness preparation, G-force readiness, emergency procedures, sensory saturation and more.

                    Executed by spaceflight-experienced instructors, you will familiarize yourself with our cabin and learn everything you need to know about the Virgin Galactic flight path and experience. As part of the Virgin Galactic flight team, you’ll be able to spend time with mission operations, pilots, engineers, and others. This preparation will be balanced with time to reflect and unwind with loved ones and crew.

                <p>Space is best enjoyed with those you love! During your spaceflight reservation call, we can discuss your options for multiple seats, or a full spaceship charter (up to 6 seats).

                    A single waitlist place can be used to make a reservation of any size, and you’ll be assigned sequential seats once the reservations are completed.
                    
                    *Charter size will depend on your flight vehicle</p>
